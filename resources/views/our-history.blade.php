                From modest beginnings the firm, Scanlen & Holderness, was founded by Sir 
                Thomas Scanlen. Born in 1834, the son of 1820 settlers, Thomas Scanlen’s early years were taken up with participating in the frontier wars in 
                the Eastern Cape, being educated and looking after his father’s general dealer business and opening his law practice. 
                    Sir Thomas Scanlen first set foot in what was then Rhodesia in September 1894. For the previous twenty years he had been one of the most prominent 
                    personalities in the Cape. He had been a Member of Parliament from 1870 to 1895 and a Cabinet Minister for much of that time. He had been Prime 
                    Minister of the Cape from 1881 to 1884 and then the leader of the opposition for five years after stepping down as Premier. Thomas’ association 
                    with the law started in 1855 when he was admitted as Notary Public and in 1866 when he was admitted as an Attorney. He then participated in various partnerships, 
                    Scanlen and Gifillan, Scanlen and Metcalf, Fairbridge, Ardene and Scanlen and finally Scanlen and Syfret. During Scanlen’s premiership, a cabinet reshuffle
                    took place bringing Cecil John Rhodes into Scanlen’s Ministry, as Treasurer. This event created the link, which eventually brought Scanlen up to Rhodesia in 
                    August 1894.

                In 1894 Rhodes offered Sir Thomas the appointment of Chief Legal Officer in Rhodesia. He was made Legal Advisor to the British South Africa Company 
                and started his own legal firm. The firm of Scanlen and Syfret commenced business in Salisbury in October 1894. Sir Thomas was only admitted as an attorney in 
                Rhodesia on 5 November 1894, at the first High Court Session to be held in Salisbury presided over by Judge Joseph Vincent. By the date of his admission, 
                Sir Thomas had already executed at least two deeds of transfer on 22 October and 1 November 1894 respectively. That this was possible was due to the fact that the 
                laws of the Cape Colony had been adopted by Rhodesia at the order of Cecil Rhodes. Hence no difficulty arose in practicing both in the Cape and in Rhodesia simultaneously. 
                Thus the early deeds executed by Sir Thomas reflect his firm as “Scanlen & Syfret, Cape Town and Salisbury”. At this time in Salisbury there were some two hundred and fifty 
                buildings. Of these, twenty-four were retail businesses, six were bars, nine were hotels, two were manufacturers with very limited number of professional and trades people. 
                When Sir Thomas took up full time involvement with the Chartered Company in 1898, his son, Arthur Dennison Scanlen, who had completed his law degree at Oxford University, 
                joined his father’s firm. In 1908 Sir Thomas became seriously ill with malaria. He was not expected to survive, but old warhorse that he was, he did so and over the next 
                few years travelled up the East Coast of Africa to Egypt and the following year through Palestine, Greece, Italy and Switzerland. Sir Thomas Scanlen died in Salisbury on May 15th 1912.
